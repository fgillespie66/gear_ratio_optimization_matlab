6.832 Project for Gear Ratio Optimization using the Mini Cheetah in Deep Note + Drake
Adi Mehrotra and Fiona Gillespie

## Initial Notes

This project was completed for the Spring 2022 MIT 6.832 Underactuated Robotics course taught by Professor Russ Tedrake in conjuction with the MIT Biomimetic Robotics Lab (Professor Sangbae Kim). The aim of this project was to determine initial effects of gear ratio on the maximum jump height for an MIT Mini Cheetah leg using accurate actuation modeling. We performed dynamic simulation and trajectory optimization on both a 1DoF jumping leg as well as a 2DoF jumping leg.

### Use and Terms

All code in this repository is publically avaliable under the MIT License but we ask if you use any of the code to please cite the MIT Biomimetic Robotics Lab.

Outputs:
- saved plot of gear ratios vs max height
- video of hoppers with different gear ratios side by side jumping
- compare control system to known control systems (e.g. bang bang, PID)
