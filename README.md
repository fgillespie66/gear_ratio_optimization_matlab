6.832 Project for Gear Ratio Optimization using the Mini Cheetah in Deep Note + Drake
Adi Mehrotra and Fiona Gillespie

Outputs:
- saved plot of gear ratios vs max height
- video of hoppers with different gear ratios side by side jumping
- compare control system to known control systems (e.g. bang bang, PID)
